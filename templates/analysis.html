              <p>The players we selected for the table under the "Draft Picks 2021" were done so after careful analysis using Machine Learning and player stats from NCAA Men's Basketball Division I schools. The data necessary to complete the projected was scraped from several online sources and then complied for analysis. We analyzed the data by training the data on a linear regression model to determine who would not be drafted, and who had a chance of being drafted. Due to the sginificant difference in the amount of data for drafted and undrafted players, only 60 possible draft candidates per season against hundreds of undrafted players, our biggest challenge was ensuring percision in our model. However, we were able to overcome this issue and present to you the indivduals we believe will be drafted in the 2021 NBA Draft.</p>
              <p>In the sidebar you will find several different data visualizations as well as a location to input your own statistics to determine their viability in the NBA draft.</p>

## Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas was used to clean and analyze our initial data.

### Database Storage
PgAdmin is the database we are using and will be we will intergrate a Flask to display the data.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we will be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is LogisticRegression.

### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also intergrate D3.js gpt s fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on GitHub.
